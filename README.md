# **Fashion MNIST Deep Learning Classifier**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a neural network classifier to identify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images, each of size 28x28 pixels, representing 10 fashion categories. This project demonstrates key steps such as data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment.

The entire project is implemented in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## **Introduction**
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, designed as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The goal of this project is to classify images into one of 10 categories, including T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

The project showcases how to:
- Load and preprocess image data.
- Build a neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.
- Train the model on training data and evaluate it using test data.
- Save and load the trained model.
- Use the model to make predictions on new data.

## **Dataset**
- **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST
- **Number of Classes**: 10
- **Input Data**: 28x28 grayscale images
- **Number of Images**: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing
- **Labels**:
  - 0: T-shirt/top
  - 1: Trouser
  - 2: Pullover
  - 3: Dress
  - 4: Coat
  - 5: Sandal
  - 6: Shirt
  - 7: Sneaker
  - 8: Bag
  - 9: Ankle boot

## **Model Architecture**
The neural network model consists of the following layers:
1. **Input Layer**: Flatten the 28x28 pixel image into a 1D vector of 784 elements.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation for non-linearity.
3. **Output Layer**: A softmax activation function is used to classify the image into one of the 10 categories.

### **Key Features**:
- Dense layers with different numbers of neurons.
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Adam optimizer for training.

## **Training and Evaluation**
The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset. The key steps include:
- **Loss Function**: Sparse categorical cross-entropy is used as the loss function.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer is used for efficient gradient-based optimization.
- **Metrics**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy.

## **Results**
The model achieves a high level of accuracy on both the training and test datasets. The key evaluation metrics and performance are:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~94%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~91%

### **Confusion Matrix**
A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the model's performance in predicting each class.
